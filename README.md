# React Basics
### Definition
React JS is a JavaScript Library for building front end application or user interfaces (UI). It allows us to create reusable UI components. It is the most popular JS front-end framework in use today. It was released by Facebook in 2013 and they still use it today for many of their applications. Manly it is used in three places: web development, mobile app development and desktop app development.
### Setting up
We need text editor and web browser. 
We need NPM- itâ€™s a package manager, it comes with NodeJS, so we need to install NodeJS.
Webpack- module bundler
Babel- toolchain which converts modern codes into compatible version of JS in current and older browsers.
### React JSX
JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript used in ReactJS that allows writing JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. In other words, it is a kind of templating language but with the power of JavaScript. It makes writing codes easier.
### Components
React is component-based framework. An example of a component could be a form or even just a form field or button on a website. We could build up complete applications using such components by simply nesting them. Components in React can manage their own state and communicate that state to child components. Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. Components come in two types, Class components and Function components.
### Creating a new react app
There are many steps involved. At first, we need to install NodeJS and then we can start installing React using npm. 
*Create React App* is a tool, built by developers at Facebook that gives us a massive head start when building React app. It saves us from time consuming setup and configuration. We can simply run one command(create-react-app) and it will set up all the tools we need to start a React project.
```
**Syntax:**
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
